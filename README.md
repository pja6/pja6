# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is  Paul Aguilar


### A little About Me:

I'm currently a PostBac at EWU studying Computer Science. My github is mostly full of projects completed during the school year, though I hope to find time to start adding some of my own personal ones too!

Some of my interests include Web & Software Dev, but I'm also learning a lot about databases, cybersecurity and dev ops which has been really cool!

### Skills:
#### A few of the tools that I've used:

### Some cool developments:

#### This quarter I started using frameworks like Astro and Tailwind CSS!

#### Also, I learned a little about using API's in my websites along with JavaScript to make everything more dynamic
